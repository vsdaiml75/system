└── package.json
```

**2. Key Components:**
- **API Layer**: REST endpoints for requisition operations
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic for resource requisition
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database operations, message queue interactions
- **Service Layer**: Orchestration of business operations

**3. Database Design:**
- Separate database for this service (Database per Service pattern)
- Tables:
  - Requisitions
  - ResourceDistributions
  - ResourceDates
  - RequisitionStatus
  - RequisitionHistory

**4. Containerization:**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds
- Separate containers for:
  - Application
  - Database
  - Cache (if needed)
- Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes manifests for production

**5. External Communications:**
- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for asynchronous events
- Service mesh for inter-service communication

**6. Key Features:**
- Circuit breakers for external service calls
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Error handling
- Logging & Monitoring
- Health checks

**7. Dependencies on Other Services:**
- Master Data Service: For projects, departments, etc.
- User Service: For authentication/authorization
- Notification Service: For status updates
- Resource Management Service: For availability checks

**8. Security:**
- JWT validation
- Role-based access control
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- Request/Response encryption where needed

**9. Scalability Considerations:**
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Database sharding strategy
- Caching strategy
- Connection pooling

**10. Monitoring & Observability:**
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging

**11. CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Build stages
- Test stages
- Security scanning
- Container registry push
- Deployment strategies

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or discuss specific implementation details for any component?
